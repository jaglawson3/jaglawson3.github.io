				<h2>tat tvam asi = "Thou art That"</h2>
			</p>
			<p>When I was a graduate student, a professor gave me a simple and profound gift. He taught me one of the most important phrases in Hinduism. Tat tvam asi. At first, it meant nothing, and then that all changed. I found my mind peeled back permanently. For those who are unfamiliar, the Vedas are Hindu holy texts. They are considered to be the oldest form of Hindu scripture.</p>

			<p>Specifically this phrase is from This phrase comes from the Chandogya Upanishad of the Samaveda. The Upanishads deal largely with spiritual knowledge. The Samaveda is one of four foundation texts of ancient Hinduism. The Samaveda was created during the late bronze age and iron age of humanity. These texts have been passed down orally from generation to generation with incredible exactitude through the use of complex mnemonic devices. For example, memorization of these sacred texts included up to eleven forms of recitation of the same verse. The Vedas were likely not written for the first time until sometime around 500 BCE. However, being predominantly an oral tradition, very few historical copies of the vedas exist for more than a few hundred years. THe oldest extant in the modern era is a copy of the Rigveda from the 14th century.</p>

			<p>The Upanishads are a subdivision within the Vedas which represent information related to spiritual knowledge derived from ancient meditation practice. The phrase that changed my life is about as simple in terms of structure as it gets. <strong>Tat tvam asi</strong>, means literally <strong>thou art that</strong>. Or you are that. Despite it's simplistic formulation, it speaks to a highly complex spiritual principle which is one of the primary foundations of the Vedanta school of Hinduism.</p>

			<p>In Hinduism, the notion is that only those who have completed the Sadhanas (mind purification excercises) are qualified to understand phrases such as <strong>tat tvam asi</strong>.So quite literally from the perspective of Vedanta, all selves are the same self, all selves are Atman. And Atman along with everything else in existence, from concrete to Nuetron stars are all Brahman. The supreme reality tricks itself and hides within manifestation. So discovering Brahman from that perspective, you are not discovering this information. You are remembering it. You are waking up.</p>

			<p>This phrase links everything there is as being an expression of the same divine principle. This is not to say that you are God personally. Well, in a way it is and it is not. But the thing behind your human identity, that lies beyond time and space is at its most basic level is Brahman. It speaks to a truly unimaginable order of complexity and interconnection. When I first heard this phrase, it was lost on me. However, there was a moment that came weeks later, when it actually dawned on me. I was sitting in a classroom and literally my mouth fell open. I could not believe how incredibly transformative this moment was. I sat there looking around the room and cataloguing everything in the room, chairs, desks, carpet, walls, people, sunlight, air, space, sound etc. All of it was the same thing. Not me as a human being. Not even me as a thinking being. It was greater than and inclusive of that. All of it was the same thing. All of it was vibration and expression that came from the same source. It was all connected. I finally saw myself for the illusion that I was. I was time bound and would inevitably decay and die. However, that no longer meant the same thing to me.</p>

			<p>As with many intense realizations, it was time limited and this sensation eventually went away. However, the lasting impact of that experience has stayed with me ever since. None of us is alone. None of us is separate. We are and always have been the same Atman, emerging from the same ground of Brahman.</p>

			<p>There are certain experiences that are beyond words. I am trying to convey what I felt in that moment. Alas, it is only a pale approximation. The point is, that you are that. You are everything and everything is you. Not the tiny little you with a name, address, profession and history. It is bigger and more spiritually profound than any of that could ever be. For me, this phrase changed my life. It showed me that I didn't have to be a Hindu, Muslim or a Buddhist, a Christian or a Jain for it to be true for me. It spoke to something deep within me that I can't name. Something that looks throught the eyes of every being in the universe.</p>
